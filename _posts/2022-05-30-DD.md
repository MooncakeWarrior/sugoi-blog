# AliceSoft Strikes Again!


## Dohna Dohna is a game released in 2020 and the english version in 2021. It’s an eroge that contains various genres that are both good and bad. 


# History

AliceSoft can be considered as one of the top makers of eroge. They are a company that gives no fucks when it comes to disapproval sounds of their contents. All of their games have questionable contents in it and may be uncomfortable but they still acquired a large amount of supporters.


# Dohna Dohna

Dohna Dohna gained quite a lot of attention when it first came out, both good and bad. One of the reasons behind the bad attention is that it is a game that contains kidnappings, prostitution and NTR. Of course many people disagreed that this type of content should be put in a game and may cause bad influences. But it’s an eroge and AliceSoft gave it a green light to release it in the public.


## The Core

The core gameplay of Dohna Dohna is simple, the city you live in is controlled by a big corporation and you are one of the groups that wants to fight against them. Of course, doing everything in the world need money and the way that groups like you make money is to kidnap citizen and turn them into prostitute. So to put it simply, the corporation is evil but you guys are evil as well. I guess this is what they say combat poison with poison huh.


## The Tags

Let’s put it straight, Dohna Dohna has two different sides of things and each event actually have a happy and bad ending. Which means that in a run you can avoid all the bad endings and enjoy a wholesome eroge. Yes, wholesome. On the flip side, you can trigger all bad endings and enjoy all the different CGs and art if you are into those contents. It’s easy to determine which path you want to go and on my first walkthrough I did not trigger even one bad event or endings which I consider a victory. A full list of the tags would be Wholesome, NTR, BDSM, Exhibitionism, Shota, Loli, Impregnation, Sex Toys, Prostitution, Humiliation.


## The Art 

For some weird reasons, I am totally in love with the artstyle of this game. It’s a cartoonish and vibrant art style and it does not look out of place in this game at all. Some of the art of these games are definitely wallpaper worthy. Below are some of the art I likes a lot.

## The Sound

The soundtrack is wonderful. To be honest, it is the soundtrack that misled me into thinking that this is just a normal game not an eroge. With the most famous songs named Dohna Dohna no Uta (definitely a banger) you can feel the amount of work and the quality of the game. Not only that one song but the entire OST is actually quite enjoyable as well and it definitely does not give off a feeling of an eroge.


## The Story

The story is good full stop. It caters to a variety of players that are into different tastes and so I feel like it’s complete. It does not leave you on a cliffhanger and completes everything along with some surprises. It’s satisfying.


# The Final Words

Play this at your discretion. As I said before, some people will be really uncomfortable with the premises of this game. Overall, it was quite an enjoyable eroge.
